# Evolutionary-Simulator

The EA chosen for this project is NEAT (Neuro-Evolution for Augmented Topologies). 
The chosen algorithm will be used to implement our agent into its 2D environment and allow it to react to its surroundings.

To implement the selected algorithm different kinds of languages were considered however,
C# by itself has a more extensive collection of libraries to choose from and has a finer optimisation for graphics-based projects,
APIs and frameworks such as OpenGL and MonoGame. 

MonoGame uses the C# language to develop its projects,
a language already familiar to those who already have experience in games development and Unity.
The framework uses Visual Studio as its primary IDE and will be used to implement the sumulation,
environment and the agent which will be evaluated in the future stages. 

To implement NEAT into MonoGame, the SharpNEAT library was used and applied accordingly into the simulation.
The SharpNEAT library offers all the characteristics of NEAT and allows C# and .NET developers to implement it into their own projects.
It offers from a number of already developed tools and visualisations of the neural network such as fitness distribution,
evaluations and the mean fitness across all generations. 

The current github repository only shows early development however,
I hold the finished project. Contact me if you wish to have a look
